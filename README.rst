Hey Jeff,
This is a bit of a misuse of a pull request, but I couldn't find another way to contact you. I'm a Masters Student at ETH Zurich, and I would like to use the elas_ros package for my research. But I am not able to build the package.  Here would be the deal: you tell me how to build the package, and I document it in the readme-file, such that for the future other people can use this (very interesting) package more easily. :) What do you think? my email: heimsi@ethz.ch
